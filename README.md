# Numerical PDEs

This repository contains my personal implementation of some numerical PDEs-related projects using C++. Each project comes with its own set of reference tests and a Chinese test report.

## Contents

The repository covers the following projects:

- Boundary Value Problems solver
- Initial Value Problems solver
- Multigrid Methods


## Usage

For instructions on how to use these projects, please refer to the `README.md` file within each specific project.
